# Supply-Demand Analysis by Region

This project aims to analyze supply-demand gaps based on different regions using linear regression.

## Overview

The project processes data from `finaldata1` to calculate supply-demand gaps for various regions. It utilizes linear regression to model and predict these gaps based on factors such as price, weather conditions, temperature, and PM2.5 levels.

## Features

- Calculates supply-demand gaps per region.
- Uses linear regression to model the relationship between factors and gaps.
- Provides insights into regional supply-demand dynamics.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Ensure `finaldata1` is correctly formatted and accessible.
   - Execute the Python script `supply_demand_analysis.py`.

## Usage

- Modify `finaldata1` or adjust parameters in `supply_demand_analysis.py` to analyze different datasets or factors.
- View results in `real_gaps` after running the script.
